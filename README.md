# Voting Client

Client element of a voting application that displays the entries to be voted. Entries are voted on by clicking on the entry that you would like to vote for. By going to "/results", one can see the current tally as well as start the next vote or restart the current vote. Each client is prevented from voting multiple times, and is locked from clicking the entry again. React Router v4 also implemented! Server element can be found [here](https://github.com/TheSivaMuthusamy/voting-server)
